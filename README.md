# Sales-Forecasting-of-Woody-s-Cafe

The goal of this project is to use the data from Woody's cafe at Rutgers University and build a sales forecasting model. The content of the repository include the presentation slides of this project. The data is confidential and hence I could not upload the python notebook and the dataset used.

Outcomes from this project:

Forecasted the sales of Woodyâ€™s Cafe up to 28 days into the future to efficiently manage and allocate resources

Discerned the significance of a proper sliding window technique for accurate predictions in Time-series forecasting.
